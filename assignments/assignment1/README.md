# Exercise 1

In this task, we will implement some machine learning methods that will help us with the implementation of neural networks in the following tasks.

Before completing the assignment:
- Run the file `download_data.sh` to download the data that we will use for training.
- Install all the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if you haven't worked with pip before, go here - https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/).
